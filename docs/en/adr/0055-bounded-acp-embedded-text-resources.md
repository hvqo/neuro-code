# ADR 0055 — Bounded ACP embedded text resources

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/adr/0055-bounded-acp-embedded-text-resources.md) · **English**

- Status: Accepted

## Context

An ACP client can include `EmbeddedResourceContentBlock` values whose resource
already contains text or a base64 binary blob. Treating the URI as a path or
network address would add unrequested filesystem or network authority to the
ACP interface. Treating a blob as text would create a second unbounded binary
input path. At the same time, already-provided text is useful context and the
existing ordered text `ContentPart` path persists it safely through model
providers and durable session history.

## Decision

For the text-only slice defined at this ADR's acceptance, ACP accepted only
`TextResourceContents` from an embedded resource block. It used the supplied
text directly, never opened, resolved, downloaded, or dereferenced the
associated URI. The URI and optional MIME type became a bounded JSON origin
label before the text. The block accepted at most eight resources, 64 KiB of
text per resource, and 128 KiB of embedded-resource text per prompt. Empty URI
or text values, and every malformed or oversized value, failed closed.

The resulting value for that text-only path is an ordered text `ContentPart`;
normal conversation storage, provider adaptation, redaction, and visible-history
projection apply.
It is input data rather than trusted instruction. Block, resource, and
annotation `_meta` values and annotations are not projected. No resource bytes
are fetched or decoded.

The current prompt-content boundary also accepts bounded `BlobResourceContents`
and inline audio blocks; other unsupported prompt blocks remain rejected.
Binary multimedia history replay remains outside this decision.

## Consequences

Clients can attach small, explicit text such as an editor buffer or generated
review note without granting the agent any new read or network capability.
The model and a later ACP history replay receive an honest origin label and
bounded text, while clients cannot use this path to make Neuro Code inspect an
arbitrary URI or recover binary attachments. Native binary attachments,
resource resolution, and richer embedded-resource semantics require separate
authority, size, persistence, and replay decisions.
