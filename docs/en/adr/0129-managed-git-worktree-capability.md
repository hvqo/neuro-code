# ADR 0129: Application-owned managed Git worktree capability

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/adr/0129-managed-git-worktree-capability.md) · **English**

- Status: Accepted for the first local lifecycle slice
- Date: 2026-08-22
- Scope: local Git worktree creation, ownership, inspection, reconciliation, and safe removal

## Context

Neuro Code already has canonical filesystem identity, workspace target
resolution, per-binding sandbox construction, repository instruction
discovery, and workspace-scoped LSP ownership. It did not yet have a typed
identity for a Git repository or a durable owner for linked worktrees. A raw
path is insufficient: a main checkout and a linked worktree have different
workspace roots but share Git common metadata, and a `.git` entry may be a
file rather than a directory.

The source checkout may also be dirty. Creating a worker worktree must not
stash, commit, clean, copy, or otherwise rewrite those changes.

## Decision

Add one application-owned capability with this boundary:

```text
ApplicationComposition
        |
WorktreeApplicationService
        |
typed GitWorktreePort + ManagedWorktreeStore
        |
LocalGitWorktreeAdapter + SQLite worktrees.db
        |
isolated managed worktree
```

The service is explicit and is not exposed as an arbitrary Git command tool.
`ApplicationComposition.create_worktree_service()` wires the service to the
configured state directory; callers must initialize it before use. The same
configured state directory deterministically owns both the managed root and
`worktrees.db`, so separate `ApplicationComposition` instances reopen the
same ownership history. Session cleanup does not own or delete this database.

### Domain and ownership

The domain exposes immutable `WorktreeId`, `WorktreeRepositoryIdentity`,
`WorktreeCreateRequest`, `WorktreeSnapshot`, `WorktreeHandle`, lifecycle
states, and `WorktreeWorkspaceBinding`. A snapshot records the canonical Git
common directory, source worktree, Git directory, repository HEAD observed at
creation, exact base commit, managed path, branch mode, ownership, state, and
creation metadata. Raw Git porcelain dictionaries never cross the adapter
boundary.

The managed root is `<state_dir>/worktrees/<repository-id>/<worktree-id>`.
The service rejects overlap with the source checkout, option-like/invalid
branch names, existing IDs, existing target paths, and existing branches. The
default managed branch namespace is `neuro/worktree/<id>`.

### Git contract

The adapter submits an argv-safe `SandboxedProcessRequest` to the canonical
`LocalProcessSandbox` port; it does not create subprocesses directly or use a
shell. Terminal prompting is disabled, and stdout/stderr, time, cancellation,
and child termination are bounded. Every managed Git invocation prepends
command-scoped `-c core.hooksPath=<Neuro-owned-empty-directory>` and
`-c core.fsmonitor=false`. The hooks directory is created by the adapter and
must remain an empty regular directory; a symlink or non-empty directory fails
closed. These settings neutralize repository and global hook/fsmonitor
configuration without relying on `/dev/null`.

`ProcessTreeLocalProcessSandbox` with `SandboxProfile.OFF` provides the existing
process lifecycle bridge, not OS-enforced filesystem or network isolation. The
Git capability therefore does not claim isolation from that request field. It
does avoid explicit remote transports (`fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `clone`, and
prune), and it neutralizes or rejects the remaining implicit checkout
execution surfaces. Before checkout, the adapter asks Git for the exact target
tree and evaluates its attributes with `check-attr`; an applicable
`filter.<driver>.smudge` or `.process` configuration fails with a typed error.

The adapter uses `git rev-parse` for repository and immutable base-commit
identity, `git check-ref-format` for branch validation, and
`git worktree list --porcelain -z` for NUL-safe typed parsing. Git 2.40.0 or
newer is required because filter preflight uses
`git check-attr --source=<tree-ish>`; older versions fail closed. Revision
resolution also uses `rev-parse --end-of-options`.

The compatibility boundary is explicit: a mocked Git version of 2.39.5 is
`NOT_AVAILABLE`, while 2.40.0 is accepted. The contract is shared by worktree
and workspace-checkpoint initialization; the filter-preflight algorithm is
not duplicated for older Git releases.

### Creation

Creation first resolves `base_revision^{commit}` to an immutable commit SHA and
preflights the exact target commit for external checkout filters. A rejected
filter leaves no durable ownership record and no worktree target. Only after
that preflight does the service insert an insert-only `CREATING` intent. Git
then creates either an exact detached worktree or a new managed branch at that
SHA. The service verifies path, repository common directory, HEAD, and branch
identity before persisting `READY`. A dirty source checkout is not read as a
patch and is not changed.

### Removal

Removal requires a durable managed record, matching repository identity,
canonical path, expected HEAD, expected branch/ref, and an actual Git record.
`git worktree remove` is used without `--force`. Dirty and locked worktrees
return typed failures and remain owned. Unknown, moved, missing, or mismatched
paths are never removed with `rm -rf`. Managed branches are retained after
worktree removal; branch deletion is a separate future capability.

### Persistence and reconciliation

`worktrees.db` has its own versioned schema and is not mixed with session turn
recovery. Schema version 2 adds a durable non-negative generation and includes
a v1-to-v2 migration that initializes existing rows at generation zero.
Unsupported versions fail closed. Ownership claims use an insert-only
operation: an existing `WorktreeId` can never be overwritten, and the
canonical path remains a SQLite `UNIQUE` key. Every later lifecycle/status
mutation is a compare-and-transition requiring the expected generation and,
when supplied, expected state; a successful mutation increments the
generation, while a stale writer receives `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION`.

SQLite and Git metadata are not treated as one transaction:

| Durable state | Actual Git state | Classification | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATING` | exact worktree exists | ready | verify and promote to `READY` |
| `CREATING` | absent | failed | retain record as `FAILED` |
| `CREATING` | unrelated path exists | orphaned | retain and fail closed |
| `READY` | exact worktree exists | ready | refresh bounded status |
| `READY` | missing or mismatched | orphaned | retain ownership record; no deletion |
| `REMOVING` | missing after removal intent | removed | promote to `REMOVED` |
| `REMOVING` | exact worktree remains | ready | reconcile failed removal |
| any active state | repository missing or common-dir mismatch | orphaned | no filesystem cleanup |

Reconciliation is explicit and is also used by managed list/inspect calls. Its
final write uses the observed generation; if another process wins the CAS, the
service rereads and returns the current coherent record without overwriting
the winner. Process death between durable intent, Git action, and finalization
is therefore recoverable without claiming cross-system ACID semantics.

### Workspace, sandbox, and LSP seam

`WorktreeWorkspaceBinding` derives one canonical primary root and no inherited
additional roots from a ready immutable handle. If additional roots are later
provided, both directions of overlap with the primary root and pairwise
additional-root overlap are rejected. The same binding can be passed to the
existing filesystem target resolver, sandbox factory, and future
workspace-scoped LSP manager. Worktree creation alone does not create a
writable subagent; the separate explicit serialized slice is defined by
[ADR 0131](0131-managed-writable-subagent-workspace.md).

## Invariants

| Invariant | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Neuro Code removes only provably owned worktrees | PROVEN by service guards and removal tests |

| Applicable target-commit checkout filters fail closed | PROVEN by exact-commit `check-attr` smudge/process tests |
| `SandboxProfile.OFF` provides OS filesystem/network isolation | NOT_PROVEN; the fallback is explicitly lifecycle-only |
| SQLite intent and Git state reconcile after process death | PROVEN by the real child `os._exit()` test |
| Cross-process ownership claims and lifecycle writes are monotonic | PROVEN by insert-only/UNIQUE/CAS and real process race tests |
| Dirty, locked, mismatched, and unmanaged worktrees are never force-removed | PROVEN for dirty/locked/path-reuse cases; mismatch is fail-closed |
| Worktree is an independent workspace root | PROVEN by canonical filesystem binding integration |
| No implicit network Git operation | PROVEN by the local command allowlist |

## Not implemented

Workspace checkpoint/rollback is now a separate internal capability defined by
[ADR 0130](0130-managed-workspace-checkpoint-rollback.md). Patch or commit
integration, merge/cherry-pick/rebase, conflict resolution, automatic branch
deletion, dirty-state copying, model-facing Git/worktree tools, writable
parallel-worker orchestration, relay/DAG/leader/swarm, and automatic Ultracode
delegation remain outside this ADR. The explicit single-child writable slice
is specified separately in [ADR 0131](0131-managed-writable-subagent-workspace.md).

## Validation

The focused real-Git suite covers porcelain parsing, typed domain validation,
SQLite reopen and CAS round trips, detached and managed-branch creation,
dirty source preservation, branch collision, locked/dirty removal refusal,
canonical workspace binding including parent overlap, hook/fsmonitor/filter
adversarial cases, same-ID and same-path cross-process claims, simultaneous
remove, path reuse, remove failure, timeout/output bounds, and process-death
reconciliation for both creation and removal. Full local repository
validation remains required before publication.
