# ADR 0019: fail-closed Linux sandbox profiles

## Context

The fixed historical Rust baseline exposes `off`, `workspace`, `read-only`, and
`strict` profiles. Its observable contract separates model-provider network
access from local child-process network access and applies operating-system
filesystem restrictions to both in-process tools and spawned commands.

Neuro Code already contained workspace path validation and permission prompts,
but neither is an operating-system sandbox. Bash can address absolute paths,
and an approved command can spawn descendants. Calling a policy “workspace”
without a kernel boundary would therefore be a security misrepresentation.
Conversely, silently continuing when a user explicitly requests an unavailable
profile would weaken their request.

## Decision

`SandboxProfile` is a domain value with four canonical names. Resolution order
is CLI `--sandbox`, `NEURO_CODE_SANDBOX`, user configuration, project
configuration, then `off`. A project profile is considered only when user
configuration does not pin one, so an untrusted workspace cannot replace a
user-selected profile with `off`.

Linux is the first enforcing platform adapter:

- `off` preserves the existing unsandboxed behavior and remains the
  compatibility default. It explicitly provides no filesystem, network,
  controller-private-state, or arbitrary detached-descendant isolation.
- `workspace` starts each local child under Bubblewrap with a read-only runtime
  view and writable workspace. The trusted controller remains on the host and
  local child network remains available.
- `read-only` keeps the child workspace read-only while retaining only its
  private temporary directory. The edit tool is omitted from the model schema
  and rejects direct invocation as a second guard.
- `strict` starts each child from an empty allowlist root, read-binds required
  system and Python runtime paths, write-binds the explicitly authorized
  workspace, then remounts the root read-only.
- Bash, background Bash, stdio MCP, and enabled-profile PTY children under
  `read-only` and `strict` use a nested Linux network namespace. The parent
  agent retains network access for model APIs; each child and its descendants
  inherit the isolated namespace.

The platform adapter resolves `bwrap` and, when needed, `unshare` only from a
non-workspace, non-caller-writable executable path. It preflights the requested
child boundary before use. There is no controller namespace marker or
process-wide mount attestation. Any mismatch, missing helper, unusable
namespace, exec failure, or unsupported platform is terminal.

All current local subprocess creation continues through `LocalProcessSandbox`
and the owned `ProcessTree`. Permission approval remains an independent, earlier gate;
`--always-approve` cannot disable or weaken the selected kernel boundary.
The composition root also passes only protected environment-variable names to
the tool context; Bash removes configured provider credentials and standard or
explicit proxy variables before spawning, so their values cannot become tool
output.

## Consequences

This is intentionally partial M3 support. Linux has enforceable built-in
profiles, while macOS and Windows reject every explicit non-`off` profile until
their adapters exist. Custom profiles, `devbox`, deny globs, Seatbelt,
Landlock-specific optimization, and a Windows sandbox adapter remain pending.
Built-in profile persistence and resume pinning are defined separately by
[ADR 0020](0020-session-fixed-sandbox-profiles.md).

The child receives only private temporary storage; controller state, provider
settings, credentials, and session databases are never mounted into it.
`strict` exposes the active Python runtime read-only so an installation outside
system directories can start. Future tools that spawn processes must use the
same local-process port; bypassing it is prohibited.
Commands that intentionally require a provider credential need a future
explicit secret-injection capability rather than ambient inheritance.

Enabled Linux children also enter a PID namespace and use Bubblewrap's
parent-death boundary. A descendant that calls `setsid()` can leave the
controller's POSIX process group, but cannot leave that PID-namespace lifecycle.
The plain POSIX `off` adapter therefore promises only best-effort cleanup of the
original process group; it does not claim ownership of arbitrary detached
descendants.

Bind mounts are path based while hardlinks alias inodes. Before an enabled
profile is accepted, the adapter performs a bounded audit of the smaller
controller-state directory and fails closed if a regular state file has more
than one hardlink. This prevents a pre-existing workspace hardlink from exposing
credentials or session state without imposing an inode scan over every workspace
file. A same-user host process can still place other content inside an authorized
workspace before launch; that content is inside the declared workspace trust
boundary rather than controller-private state.

The source evidence for the four profile meanings, default `off`, child-only
network restriction, and startup application order is the sandbox profile and
shell startup implementation at historical commit
`c68e39f60462f28d9be5e683d9cbe2c57b1a5027`.
