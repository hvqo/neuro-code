# ADR 0153: Architecture Completion Before v1

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/adr/0153-architecture-completion.md) · **English**

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-02
- Scope: the final pre-v1 modular-monolith and ports-and-adapters consolidation
- Depends on: ADR 0049 and the interface/session boundary ADRs through ADR 0152

## Context

The repository had already established `application`, `application/ports`,
`domain`, `infrastructure`, `interfaces`, `bootstrap`, and `shared`, but several
large canonical implementations still lived at the package root. The root
modules made ownership ambiguous: the interface packages were partly wrappers,
configuration mixed value contracts with file loading, and bootstrap combined
process launch, concrete service selection, factory policy, and resource graph
assembly.

This was an internal architecture migration before the first release. The
objective was therefore to make ownership visible in the source tree while
preserving the existing CLI, TUI, ACP, Runtime, Provider, permission, sandbox,
session, persistence, and security behavior.

## Decision

The package root is closed to production implementation modules. Its source
tree contains only `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, and the architectural packages:
`application`, `bootstrap`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `interfaces`, and
`shared`.

The inbound adapters have these canonical owners:

- `interfaces.cli.app` is a thin public facade preserving the established
  parser and runner import points. `interfaces.cli.parser` owns the complete
  CLI grammar and defaults; `interfaces.cli.settings` owns parsed-option
  conversion and permission-rule normalization; `interfaces.cli.dispatch`
  owns top-level routing and exit-code/error mapping. `interfaces.cli.agent`,
  `interfaces.cli.subagents`, and `interfaces.cli.session_io` own the
  headless-agent, subagent, and session import/export command families.
  `interfaces.cli.inspection` owns read-only version, inspect, completion, and
  provider presentation; `interfaces.cli.sessions` owns the parsed sessions
  command boundary. `interfaces.cli.contracts` and `interfaces.cli.interaction`
  own shared CLI contracts and the terminal stdin adapter, while
  `interfaces.cli.serialization` remains the bounded projection owner.
- `interfaces.tui.app` owns only the Textual lifecycle, high-level wiring, and
  app-owned state. `interfaces.tui.contracts`, `interaction`, and `state` own
  TUI contracts and local models; `widgets` and `screens` own reusable visual
  surfaces; `controllers` owns cohesive turns, commands, preferences,
  provider/session selection, plans/tasks, background, transcript, runtime, and
  tool-activity orchestration. The existing `commands`, `text`, `theme`, and
  `tool_activity` modules remain their canonical owners.
- `interfaces.acp.agent` owns the public ACP protocol facade and high-level
  wiring. `interfaces.acp.negotiation`, `session_registry`,
  `session_lifecycle`, `mcp`, `extensions`, and `prompt` own connection
  negotiation, published session state, session lifecycle, live MCP handling,
  private extension dispatch, and prompt/permission execution respectively;
  the existing `content`, `updates`, `client_io`, `mcp_config`, `transport`,
  and `session` modules remain the canonical owners of their boundaries.

The former root implementations `neuro_code.cli`, `neuro_code.tui`,
`neuro_code.acp`, `neuro_code.tui_commands`, `neuro_code.tui_text`, and
`neuro_code.tui_theme` are removed. No root compatibility wrapper remains
authoritative.

Configuration has one explicit split:

- `application.ports.configuration` owns immutable `AppConfig` and
  `ProviderProfile` values, validation, and explicit-input configuration
  policy. It does not read the process environment, probe optional packages,
  or resolve filesystem paths.
- `bootstrap.configuration` owns TOML, environment, CC Switch, legacy-format,
  managed-overlay, path resolution, and stored-credential loading.
- `infrastructure.providers.binding` owns concrete environment-credential and
  optional HTTP-capability resolution immediately before provider construction.
- `infrastructure.providers.managed_provider_settings` owns the concrete
  managed JSON reader.
- `application.ports.provider_dialects` owns dialect inference used by the
  application-facing contract.

Bootstrap has one explicit composition split:

- `bootstrap.entrypoints` is a lazy, thin process launcher.
- `bootstrap.cli` selects concrete CLI/TUI services.
- `bootstrap.acp` contains ACP workspace and MCP composition adapters.
- `bootstrap.factories` owns default concrete factory selection.
- `bootstrap.composition` remains the public composition root and owns shared
  state assembly. `bootstrap.composition_lifecycle` owns process-resource
  acquisition, initialization, shutdown ordering, and failure unwind;
  `bootstrap.composition_bindings` owns per-conversation binding construction;
  `bootstrap.composition_services` owns application service facades;
  `bootstrap.composition_subagents` and `bootstrap.composition_workflows` own
  the subagent/workflow factory families; and
  `bootstrap.composition_discovery` owns instruction and skill discovery. These
  are method-owning mixins over the same root instance, not a service locator or
  additional runtime state owner.

Architecture tests enforce the source-tree boundary and scan production imports
for the forbidden directions `interfaces -> infrastructure/bootstrap`,
`application -> infrastructure/interfaces/bootstrap`,
`domain -> application/infrastructure/interfaces/bootstrap`, and
`infrastructure -> interfaces/bootstrap`. The existing narrow entrypoint edge
and any intentional compatibility exports are tested explicitly rather than
being hidden by a broad allowlist.

## Consequences

The directory structure now communicates the intended modular-monolith
architecture without requiring `architecture.md` to explain which root module
is authoritative. Interface imports do not assemble concrete infrastructure,
and application ports do not load bootstrap configuration or providers.

The refactor is behavior-preserving: command grammar, output and exit codes,
TUI presentation and shortcuts, ACP wire semantics, Runtime and Provider
behavior, permission and sandbox gates, and session persistence semantics are
unchanged.

The TUI decomposition deliberately keeps `interfaces.tui.app` as the lifecycle
and wiring owner; its controller mixins are split by reason to change and do
not import the app module. `infrastructure.persistence.sqlite_session` remains
the one SQLite session-store/schema/transaction owner. Neither boundary is
duplicated or weakened.
