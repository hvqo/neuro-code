# ADR 0124 — Runtime parity and bounded integration

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/adr/0124-runtime-parity-and-bounded-integration.md) · **English**

- Status: Accepted for the current pre-alpha runtime
- Date: 2026-08-21

## Context

At this ADR's acceptance, the existing design deliberately landed narrow
vertical slices: a safe tool pipeline, session-owned MCP tools, partial ACP
stdio, provider-neutral compaction, and explicit read-only subagents. That
boundary made the system safe, but left several integration gaps visible to
clients: model requests had
no compact reconstruction evidence, independent read-only tool calls were
always serialized, MCP capability lists were tool-only, provider failures had
no bounded retry/circuit policy, and user permission rules were not durable.

The implementation must preserve the existing ownership rules. A scheduler
must not execute tools outside the permission/workspace/sandbox pipeline; MCP
must remain session-owned; untrusted protocol content must stay bounded and
redacted; and provider retries must never repeat a request after observable
model output.

## Decision

The following bounded integrations are production capabilities:

- Every model step emits a non-secret request snapshot containing context/tool
  fingerprints and shape counts. The full reconstruction payload remains
  in-memory only.
- Read-only tool calls may run in bounded parallel groups. Side-effecting and
  interaction-control tools are exclusive. Canonical terminal results are
  emitted for completed, failed, rejected, cancelled, and not-started calls;
  pipeline hooks observe the same redacted boundary.
- ACP-owned MCP sessions enumerate resources, resource templates, and prompts;
  they support bounded reads, refresh, sampling, and elicitation through a
  private namespaced extension. Tool names are replaced atomically on refresh.
- ACP accepts bounded audio and embedded binary prompt content. It preserves
  the content in the model context, while providers without native media
  support receive safe placeholders. A WebSocket newline-JSON bridge reuses
  the stdio ACP router and the same session, permission, and workspace gates.
- Explicit subagent scheduling is available behind a scope-aware application
  service. It bounds parallelism, retries, timeouts, depth, recursive spawn,
  tool names, and write capability, and closes every fresh child runtime.
- Provider adapters are wrapped with pre-output retry and cooldown circuit
  protection. TUI model discovery uses a bounded atomic cache that stores only
  model identifiers and falls back to recent data for classified network
  failures; credentials are never persisted.
- Permission rules support path/operation matching and a bounded atomic JSON
  store. Loading remains explicit at the CLI/composition boundary; local deny,
  workspace, sandbox, approval, and redaction checks remain authoritative.
- Context compaction is wired at runtime safe points when the session and
  provider capacity are known, and is available explicitly through CLI, TUI,
  ACP, and session-facing application calls. Durable compaction rows remain
  provider-neutral and separate from provider generation; the existing SQLite
  turn-finalization transaction remains the owner of whole-turn atomicity.

## Compatibility boundary

At this ADR's acceptance, this decision did not claim stateful Responses
`previous_response_id` chains, automatic Ultracode delegation, model-generated
titles, arbitrary plugin or hook execution, ACP-transport MCP server
declarations, interactive client PTY input/resize/framing, or native audio/video
provider semantics. Later bounded slices implement automatic Ultracode
delegation/result adoption. Binary multimedia is accepted and bounded at the
ACP/domain boundary, but binary history replay and provider-native handling
remain explicit future capabilities.

## Consequences

The runtime now has shared evidence and result contracts for CLI, TUI, ACP,
replay, and diagnostics without duplicating prompt or credential stores. The
cost is that parallel read-only execution needs private transcript projections,
MCP metadata is exposed only through a private extension, and some integrations
remain intentionally partial until their external protocol contracts are
stable and tested.
