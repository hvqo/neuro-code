# ADR 0158: Turn workspace checkpoint and undo

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/adr/0158-turn-workspace-checkpoint-undo.md) · **English**

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-11
- Scope: B1 latest-only normal-turn workspace undo

## Context

The existing checkpoint engine safely captures and restores the Git-visible
projection of a Neuro Code-owned managed worktree, but a normal user run uses
the source checkout. A raw path cannot be used as checkpoint authority and the
source checkout must not be inserted into the managed-worktree ownership
store. B1 needs one latest-only, durable undo target for eligible normal-turn
mutations without changing Git history or turn recovery.

## Decision

Bootstrap issues a typed `SourceWorkspaceCheckpointGrant` only after proving
the canonical repository identity, source path, current HEAD, and branch or
detached state through the existing Git port. The checkpoint application
service re-proves that grant before capture and rollback. Managed worktree
handles retain their existing ownership proof.

`TurnWorkspaceCheckpointCoordinator` creates one checkpoint after permission
approval and immediately before the first bounded primary-workspace mutation.
Eligible later mutations in that turn reuse it. Read-only and denied
operations create none. An unbounded, ignored, unsupported, or unprovable
mutation first appends a durable `UNAVAILABLE` association; if that write
fails, the mutation is rejected. The association is a bounded
`WORKSPACE_UNDO_STATE` session event with latest-only `AVAILABLE`,
`ROLLING_BACK`, `UNAVAILABLE`, and `ROLLED_BACK` states. `ROLLING_BACK` is an
internal durable transition and is never presented as an available user
checkpoint. No checkpoint stack or user-facing checkpoint ID is added.

The protected image is the existing projection: tracked and non-ignored
untracked file content, staged/index bytes, binary files, supported symlinks,
and supported modes. Ignored files, external side effects, nested repositories,
submodules, special files, empty directories, and arbitrary external-process
changes are out of scope. Undo is an idle-only user action exposed by TUI
`/undo` and CLI `sessions undo <SESSION_ID>`; it does not invoke the model or
terminate live mutators. A successful rollback is verified by the existing
fingerprint state machine and produces one verification mutation handoff for a
future normal turn. It does not alter historical turn recovery or create a
second verification generation owner.

## Recovery and compatibility

After restart, an `AVAILABLE` association is eligible only after the exact
source grant, Git identity, HEAD, and projection safety checks pass. Before a
rollback begins, the association records the expected post-turn projection
fingerprint and the exact rollback-attempt identity. The idle claim and
`ROLLING_BACK` transition are persisted atomically, so a new turn cannot race
the destructive operation. `UNAVAILABLE` and `ROLLED_BACK` remain terminal.

If a source rollback is interrupted and the current projection matches
neither the expected post-turn fingerprint nor the checkpoint source, the
coordinator does not restore or guess. It asks the checkpoint service to
re-prove the typed source grant, verify that no live owner remains, and
compare-and-swap that exact `STARTED` or `INDETERMINATE` attempt to the
existing non-active `FAILED` state. Retirement records the abandoned attempt
for audit but does not claim that the workspace was restored. A live owner or
an unproven source identity prevents retirement. No automatic destructive
reconciliation is performed for unknown source state.

`MODEL_OUTPUT_STARTED`, turn recovery, and committed assistant history remain
separate facts. The existing managed checkpoint API, provider/tool contracts,
SQLite session schema, and ACP protocol are unchanged; no model-visible undo
tool is added.

## Validation

Focused tests cover typed source authority, dirty/index/untracked/binary/
symlink checkpoint behavior, latest-only association and invalidation,
concurrent first-mutation preparation, persistence failure, restart, rollback
guarding, CLI/TUI projections, live-mutator refusal, and existing managed
checkpoint/recovery regressions.
