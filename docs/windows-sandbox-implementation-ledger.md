# Windows sandbox implementation ledger

This is the temporary engineering ledger for the production Windows sandbox.
It is intentionally concise and is updated as implementation evidence changes.

## UPSTREAM_BASELINE

- OpenAI Codex repository: `https://github.com/openai/codex`
- Pinned default-branch commit: `59f7da58d6ae8401304554f807023610181f65f0`
- Primary reference: `codex-rs/windows-sandbox-rs/`
- Relevant upstream sources inspected: `token.rs`, `proc_thread_attr.rs`,
  `process.rs`, `spawn_prep.rs`, `setup.rs`, `identity.rs`, `wfp.rs`,
  `wfp_setup.rs`, `elevated/runner_client.rs`, `elevated/runner_pipe.rs`,
  and the unified-exec Windows backends, plus `desktop.rs` and
  `bin/command_runner/win.rs`.
- Upstream is Apache-2.0. This implementation adapts observable Win32
  semantics to Neuro Code's Python boundaries; no upstream source is copied
  into production.

## CONFIRMED_COMPLETE

- Neuro Code main contains the W1-W4 Windows setup, restricted-token runner,
  Job Object, pipe, and ConPTY paths.
- AppContainer Gate 2A research is frozen in PR #48 and is not a production
  dependency.
- Current native W5 evidence identifies the synthetic-only restricting-SID
  token as incompatible with CNG/KsecDD; the `synthetic + Everyone` ablation
  recovered `bcrypt.dll` and the bounded KsecDD oracle.
- The production token boundary now models capability and runtime identity
  SIDs separately: the installation synthetic write SID remains the only
  managed filesystem capability, while the sandbox user, logon SID, and World
  SID are explicit restricted-token identity entries. Final-child attestation
  validates the complete ordered set, and existing object DACLs retain only
  the capability SID as the managed workspace write principal. Focused
  non-Windows token and attestation tests pass.
- The first native run passed token/CNG/workload, security, lifecycle, and
  native acceptance jobs. Its filesystem and PTY jobs exposed the World-SID
  authority surface on an outside directory with a broad write ACE. The setup
  plan now persists explicit synthetic capability-deny ACEs for existing
  sibling boundary paths; authorized roots and unrelated principals remain
  outside that deny set.
- Boundary-deny planning now preserves fresh-setup protection for existing
  sibling files, while later READY inspections retain persisted file denies
  and add only newly-created sibling directories. This keeps inherited
  protection for future descendants without treating controller helper/marker
  files created after setup as ACL drift.
- The first capability-scoped NUL attempt exposed that a normal W2 runner
  cannot open the process-global device with ``WRITE_DAC``. The NUL grant is
  now owned by the existing elevated setup authority: it preserves unrelated
  device ACEs, adds/removes only the installation synthetic write SID,
  participates in READY/NEEDS_REPAIR inspection, and is cleaned before
  installation state is removed. The runtime runner no longer attempts a
  privileged DACL mutation.
- The current W5 compatibility artifact (run `32374860136`, source head
  `1175fa046cde263a9a1c9afbb1a32b7f6ed34914`) passes all 20 installed
  workload rows through HOST, W3 capture, and W4 ConPTY: all 60 cells are
  `PASS`, with no host failures. It covers Windows PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell
  7, normal and base Python, a Python child process, Git/local-repository
  operations, Node/npm, curl, NUL access modes, and a dynamic
  `BCryptGenRandom` probe. Every W3/W4 row reaches `SpawnReady`, passes token
  attestation, and records zero active Job processes after quiescence and zero
  output relays after join.
- The final W3 native acceptance job executes seven tests with zero skips. Gate
  5A proves natural descendant completion before `Exit`; Gates 5B, 5C, and 5D
  prove explicit termination, controller-loss cleanup, and kill-on-close Job
  ownership with no orphaned descendants. The final W4 PTY job passes the
  application routing and ConPTY acceptance gates without a second sandbox
  authority.

## CURRENT_BLOCKER

- No implementation blocker is currently known. The current-upstream parity
  audit, manually reviewed mainline integration, local gates, and the current
  full native CI run all pass.

## NEXT_ACTION

- Keep PR #49 Draft and unmerged until the owner explicitly authorizes the
  ordinary merge-commit operation. No further Windows implementation action is
  required by this audit.

## FAILED_HYPOTHESES

- AppContainer is not assumed to be the production architecture; the frozen
  evidence branch is not a runtime implementation.
- Adding AppPackage SIDs is not a valid compatibility fix: the native W5
  attribution evidence showed token creation failure for those variants.
- The synthetic-only restricted SID is not sufficient for the final Windows
  runtime: CNG/KsecDD evidence disproved that model.
- A compatibility World SID without an explicit synthetic deny lets a broad
  outside ``Everyone`` write ACE pass the restricted-side check.

## PENDING_DOD

- None. The current source head has a successful full CI run including native
  Windows token, filesystem, network, lifecycle, PTY, and workload jobs; the
  final evidence-only documentation update is also kept under the same PR
  checks.

## CI_STATE

- Current production base: `origin/main` at
  `458afc19c478c2ecc5e9c6282f318ab1358a1586`; it was manually integrated
  after the sole ledger add/add conflict was reviewed, not automatically
  accepted as a production change.
- Production branch: `feat/windows-sandbox-codex-parity`.
- Frozen evidence PR #48: `a245ffeddff66ec18cc6168081202013a2f5232a` (Draft,
  evidence-only; its Gate 2A.6 line is not production).
- Production PR #49 is Draft at `feat/windows-sandbox-codex-parity`; the
  audited source head is `1175fa046cde263a9a1c9afbb1a32b7f6ed34914`, and the
  final branch update only adds evidence documentation.
- Run `32374860136` at the audited source head is the current full CI run: all
  23 jobs succeeded, including quality, package smoke, ordinary
  Linux/Windows/macOS, Bubblewrap, Windows security/lifecycle/native
  acceptance/PTY/compatibility, terminal smoke, and macOS Seatbelt jobs. Its
  W5 artifact contains 20 rows and 60 HOST/W3/W4 cells, all `PASS`, with no
  host failures and all nine tool-provenance records passing.
- Current local gates on the merged head pass: lock check, documentation parity,
  Ruff, format check, mypy, pytest, and package build. The counts recorded when
  this ledger was last updated (134 bilingual pairs, 1,986 pytest tests, 48
  expected skips, 17 deselections, 85.15% coverage) are historical; current
  values are 179 pairs and 2,979 tests with 51 skips as of 2026-09-21.
